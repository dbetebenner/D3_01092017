New Year's Resolution for 2017: Make a D3 Block a day to teach myself D3. This is Number 9. This example
goes further into D3 map building using [topoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/topojson) showing school
districts across the United States. The topoJSON files used to construct this visualization were created by me
using [shape files](https://www.census.gov/did/www/schooldistricts/) provided by the United States Census Bureau.
[The Center for Assessment](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment) makes these
[state and national school district topoJSON files](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment/SGPspatialData) available
for anyone to use in their own development. This one is for all of the continental US.
